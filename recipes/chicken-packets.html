    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"Another once a month meal that's sure to please. My little girl likes these because they pick up easily in her hands! *I revised this recipe based on several folks pointing out that I had made a mistake on the amount of cream cheese. Thank you so much for the input!"</p>
    <p>-Excerpt taken from TishT's submission on www.food.com for the recipe.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Yields 8 servings/packets and takes approximately an hour to make this meal, 30 minutes to prep and 30 minutes to cook.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups chopped cooked chicken</li>
        <li>1 (6 - 8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chives, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup seasoned croutons, crushed to crumbs</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent dinner rolls</li>
        <li>1/4 cup melted margarine</li>
      </ul>      

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix chicken, cream cheese, chives, milk, and salt in a medium bowl (mixing with hands works best) to make filling, and store in a 1 qt freezer bag.</li>
        <li>Put crouton crumbs in another 1 qt bag, attach it to bag of chicken filling, and freeze.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate crescent rolls.</li>
        <li>To prepare for serving, thaw chicken mixture.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F.</li>
        <li>Unroll crescent rolls.</li>
        <li>Each tube will contain 4 rectangles of dough with a diagonal perforation.</li>
        <li>Press dough along each perforation so the rectangle halves will not separate.</li>
        <li>Place about 1/4 cup of the chicken mixture into the center of each rectangle.</li>
        <li>Fold dough over the filling, and pinch the edges to seal tightly.</li>
        <li>Dip each packet in melted margarine, and coat with crouton crumbs.</li>
        <li>Place packets on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Packets are good either hot or cold.</li>
      </ol>
