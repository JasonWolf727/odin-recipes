    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"Nothing packs in flavor, nutrients, and protein quite like a sticky salmon rice bowl. And when it’s filled with so many delicious ingredients (think salmon, cucumber, broccoli, soy sauce, honey, lime juice, garlic…) you can’t help but love it. </p>
    <p>This meal is made up of a few different parts, all of which come together to create a flavor-packed and extremely satisfying bowl. The recipe yields 4 servings, making it fantastic for feeding the family, enjoying as dinner and next-day lunch for two, or preparing for the week’s meal prep!"</p>
